# TODO:

# - Create a Docker compose file that will have 4 services: nginx proxy, red, yellow and green app
# - All services should be on the same _external_ network
# - Only the nginx proxy should have an exposed port 80
# - All apps (except the proxy) should have a named volume mounted
# - All apps (except proxy) should be built when we run _docker compose up_
# - Nginx proxy should build the image from the nginx directory
# - All the other apps have their own set of instructions in each directory
# - Good luck!
